    <studentAnswer id="SwitchesBulbsSeries-CLOSED_PATH_EXPLAIN.sbjb41-l1.qa23" count="1">I feel like if the circuit is open, like in diagrams 2 and 4, then the bulbs are able to connect to the batteries to light up. If the circuit is closed, then the passageway is closed off from the battery to the bulb, so there is no connection able to be made.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer id="SwitchesBulbsSeries-CLOSED_PATH_EXPLAIN.sbjb42-l1.qa22" answerMatch="answer7" count="1">both the bulb and the battery must be in a closed path</studentAnswer>
