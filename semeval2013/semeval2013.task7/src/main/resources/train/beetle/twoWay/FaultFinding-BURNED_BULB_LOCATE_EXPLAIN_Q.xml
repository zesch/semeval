    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer249" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb26-l1.qa181" accuracy="incorrect">Electrical states between connected terminals will differ than those that are separated by a gap.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer248" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb27-l1.qa180" accuracy="incorrect">where the voltage jumps from 0 volts to some number of volts represents the burned out bulb because it identifies where the circuit is only connnected to the negative battery terminal or the positive battery terminal.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer257" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb28-l1.qa185" accuracy="incorrect">The electrical state for the bulb terminal and the battery terminal will have a charge of 0 if connected so if the charge is anything that isn"t 0 V, there is a gap at that bulb</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer248" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb29-l1.qa184" accuracy="incorrect">because if there is a gap, a burned out bulb, there would be a different voltage at the connections around it</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer251" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb30-l1.qa187" accuracy="incorrect">if there is a gap between the terminals, the voltage will be different.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer257" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb31-l1.qa180" accuracy="incorrect">because a difference in voltage is due to a gap.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb32-l1.qa184" accuracy="incorrect">It will locate the gap.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer251" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb34-l1.qa180" accuracy="incorrect">By finding out which terminals are the same or different in electrical states then any gap in the circuit can be found.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer249" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb35-l1.qa182" accuracy="incorrect">Measureing the difference in electrical states of the connections lets you pin point where the gap is happening in the system.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer249" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb36-l1.qa180" accuracy="incorrect">by measuring voltage you can find where the gap is by checking the electrical states of each bulb and its voltage. If it is connected it will have volts if it is not then it will have none.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer260" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb37-l1.qa180" accuracy="incorrect">Because it determines the different electrical states between the terminals</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer249" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb38-l1.qa181" accuracy="incorrect">A burned out bulb indicates a gap in the connection between opposite ends of the battery terminals</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer251" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb39-l1.qa183" accuracy="correct">Measuring voltage shows what terminals are connected and where there is a gap so you can determins which bulb is out.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer255" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb40-l1.qa181" accuracy="incorrect">There will be a gap at one point in time and there will be a voltage decrease so you know.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer248" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb41-l1.qa183" accuracy="incorrect">Measuring voltages helps to locate burned out bulbs because if there is a gap or something isn"t connected, it will show up as a numerical electrical state.</studentAnswer>
    <studentAnswer count="1" answerMatch="answer248" id="FaultFinding-BURNED_BULB_LOCATE_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb42-l1.qa183" accuracy="correct">If a bulb is burned out, the voltage to one side of it will be zero and o the other side will be greater than zero. the burned out bulb leaves one terminal connected to the positive terminal of the battery and the other terminal connected to the negative terminal of the battery, giving each terminal a different electrical state.</studentAnswer>
